He/Him - Stay Safe

Technology was never just about machines or screens for me — it’s how I coped, grew, connected. From games and hardware to full-stack solutions, it’s been a constant companion through highs and lows.

Today, I see technology as a path for personal and collective growth. That’s why I code: not just to build, but to leave a trace of myself in every solution. I believe in solving real problems for real people — with craft, empathy, and sharp execution.

My drive comes from solving the unsolvable, shaping systems that help others thrive — and making something meaningful out of it all.

He/Him - Stay Safe

In love with trouble solving, innovation and technology. ðŸ’»

Technology, was always there for me in games or hardware Iâ€™ve used growing up worked as relief valve, not only that but also as a true way to live by, being a companion in my worst and best moments. but also as a way to grow, that is how i see technology, ways to grow as a person. Having that in mind i wish to drop a little of myself in every work i do as a developer, and as a developer solve problems of people.

Allowing us lots of ways to grow as persons. Having that in mind I wish to drop a little of myself in every work I do as a developer, and as a developer solve problems of people.
